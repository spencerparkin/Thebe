        <h1>How to Play Chinese Checkers <i>Extreme</i></h2>
        <p>
        If you already know how to play the traditional game of Chinese Checkers, then there are only a few
        more things to know about this <i>extreme</i> variation of the game.  Nevertheless, I will start at
        the beginning, because I not only explain the rules of the game here, but also how to use this software.
        </p>
        <h2>1 -- Starting a Game</h2>
        <p>
        You can begin a game by either joining a game already started by someone else, or by starting a new game yourself.
        </p>
        <h3>1.1 -- Hosting a New Game</h3>
        <p>
        Choosing <b>Host Game</b> from the <b>Game</b> menu brings up the following dialog.
        </p>
        <center><img src="Images/HostGameDialog.png"/></center>
        <p>
        Here, the <b>Game Type</b> refers to the type of board you're going to use, which also determines the maximum number
        of players that can participate in the game.  The <b>traditional</b> board can host anywhere from 2 to 6 players.
        </p>
        <p>
        There is no need to change the <b>Host Address</b> field unless there's a specific NIC you want to use.
        More likely, it's the <b>Host Port</b> field that will concern you.  Choose a free port on your system, and one
        that isn't blocked by a fire-wall.  Those who want to join your game will need to know your machine's host address
        and the port number you've chosen here.
        </p>
        <p>
        The total number of players participating will be the sum of human and computer players, which must not exceed the
        total number of players supported by the chosen board type.  Note that after a server is created, the software will
        automatically try to join the game as a human.  If there are zero human players, then it will just spectate.
        If two or more human players are specified here, then the game can't progress until enough human players join the game
        from other instances of the program running elsewhere on the network (or even the same machine.)
        </p>
        <h3>1.2 -- Joining an Existing Game</h3>
        <p>
        Choosing <b>Join Game</b> from the <b>Game</b> menu brings up the following dialog.
        </p>
        <center><img src="Images/JoinGameDialog.png"/></center>
        <p>
        Here, you just need to know the <b>Host Address</b> of the machine that's running the game server, and
        the <b>Host Port</b> that it's listening on for new connections.  What color you are in the game just
        depends on the order in which people join.
        </p>
        <h2>2 -- Taking a Turn</h2>
        <p>
        Once a game is joined, you'll see indicators specifying what color you are, and when it's your turn.
        </p>
        <center><img src="Images/Fresh2PlayerGame.png" width="700"/></center>
        <p>
        You can see here it says "<b>You are color Yellow</b>" at the bottom, and "<b>Waiting for color Yellow to take their turn.</b>"
        </p>
        <h3>2.1 -- Inspecting the Game Board</h3>
        <p>
        You only need a mouse with three buttons and a wheel to play this game.  Click and drag with the left mouse button to shift the board
        around.  Do this while holding the control key down to rotate the board about the focal point.  Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.
        Do this while holding the control key down to tilt the board up and down.
        </p>
        <h3>2.2 -- Formulating Your Turn</h3>
        <p>
        Your turn consists of choosing one of your board pieces (a Yellow piece, in this case) and then describing how it should move
        along the board in a sequence of hops.  You can either hop to an unoccupied adjacent location on the board, or you can hop over
        some other board piece (doesn't matter what color it is) to a location on the opposite side.  In this latter case you are allowed
        to do an additional hop as long as it is also a jump over some other board piece.  You can continue to do this, all in a single turn,
        as long as each additional hop jumps over another board piece.
        </p>
        <p>
        To choose the piece you want to move, right-click on it.  Doing so, a ring is placed around the piece to indicate its selection,
        as shown below.
        </p>
        <center><img src="Images/SelectedPieceToMove.png" width="700"/></center>
        <p>
        Where can this piece go?  Note that there is no immediately adjacent and unoccupied board location to which it can hop.  But it
        can hop over one of its fellow board pieces to a location you can indicate by right clicking on it as shown in the following screenshot.
        </p>
        <center><img src="Images/SingleHopMoveFormulated.png" width="700"/></center>
        <p>
        Once your hop sequence has been formulated, you can commit to executing it as your turn by middle-clicking on the final board
        location where you would like your board piece to ultimately land.  If you want to cancel this sequence, just middle-clock on some
        other board location to erase the sequence so that you can start over.  Having committed to the board sequence, the result as as follows.
        </p>
        <center><img src="Images/SingleHopTurnTaken.png" width="700"/></center>
        <p>
        You'll notice here that <b>Red</b> also took their turn.  The computer will automatically takes its own turn when it detects that the
        progress of the game is dependent upon it making a decision.
        </p>
        <h2>3 -- The Goal of the Game</h2>
        <p>
        The goal of this variation of the game is the same as that of the traditional version, but with a bit of a twist.
        Traditionally, the goal is to get all of your pieces into the target zone directly across the board before your opponent
        does the same.  That is, <b>Yellow</b> wants to move all of its pieces into the <b>Red</b> zone (where <b>Red</b> starts) before <b>Red</b>
        is able to move all of their pieces into the <b>Yellow</b> zone (where <b>Yellow</b> starts.)
        </p>
        <p>
        In the extreme variation, the goal is to get all of your <i>surviving</i> pieces into the target zone.  That's right, your pieces can
        be killed!  Note that this presents one other way to win: being the last group of pieces on the board with one or more surviving pieces
        still in play.  If all your pieces are killed (taken off the board), then you're out of contention for winning the game.
        </p>
        <h3>3.1 -- Dealing Damage to an Opponent</h3>
        <p>
        Consider the following game that has already progressed as shown below.
        </p>
        <center><img src="Images/LifeCountsAndOpportunityToDealDamage.png" width="700"/></center>
        <p>
        Note that to show these numbers above the pieces, click the <b>Show Life Counts</b> toggle button near the top-right of the window.
        </p>
        <p>
        Here you can see the number of lives assigned to each board piece.  Each initially gets 3 lives at the start of the game.
        The life-count of a piece is decremented by 1 every time an opponent pieces jumps over it.  Once the count goes to zero,
        that pieces is removed from the game.
        </p>
        <p>
        See here that we can choose to deal damage to the <b>Red</b> near the <b>Yellow</b> zone with the following hop sequence.
        </p>
        <center><img src="Images/ChoosingToDealDamage.png" width="700"/></center>
        <p>
        We could also do it using a different sequence as follows.
        </p>
        <center><img src="Images/ChoosingToDealDamageAlternate.png" width="700"/></center>
        <p>
        This is a bit ambiguous, but if you formulated the sequence, then you know that the <b>Yellow</b> piece will jump down and left,
        then over the <b>Red</b> piece toward the right.  The result is as follows (which also shows the state of the board after <b>Red</b>
        took their turn too.)
        </p>
        <center><img src="Images/DamageDone.png" width="700"/></center>
        <p>
        Here, the <b>Yellow</b> piece highlighted (with a ring) dealt damage to the <b>Red</b> piece left of it.  The computer also moved
        another <b>Red</b> near the <b>Yellow</b> zone, and in the process, dealt some damage to some <b>Yellow</b> pieces, which you can
        glean by comparing the two previous screenshots.  Note how the piece we have highlighted here is poised, ready to deal more damage
        to <b>Red</b>.  One possible move sequence we could make is as follows.
        </p>
        <center><img src="Images/DealDoubleDamage.png" width="700"/></center>
        <p>
        I think you get the idea.  You'll notice as you play the game, that instead of hopping over opponent pieces, you hop on top of
        them.  This is just for dramatic effect.  The animation has no bearing on the outcome of the game.
        </p>
        <h2>4 -- Some Considerations in Closing</h2>
        <p>
        That's basically all there is to it.  You're now ready to play!
        </p>
        <p>
        Note that in this variation of Chinese Checkers, it is not always to your advantage to kill off an opponent's piece.
        Remember, to win, they need only get their last surviving pieces into the target zone, even if they only have one left.
        </p>
        <p>
        At the time of this writing, the game is a beta, so if you find bugs, don't hesitate to send them to me at <a href="mailto:spencer.parkin@proton.me">spencer.parkin@proton.me</a>.
