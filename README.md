# Thebe

This is a graphics engine written in C++ with DirectX 12.

Following is the latest screen-shot.  Yeah, it looks like crap, but it's a work in progress.

I'm trying to do some PBR stuff here.  I think that the metalic bits will look black until I do some environment mapping.  Until then, there is nothing to reflect in the metal.

Of course, I want to add a shadow pass too.
