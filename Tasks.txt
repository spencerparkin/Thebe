Some things I'd like to achieve...

[x] Generate MIP maps for textures.
[x] Compress textures.
[ ] Add cube-maps for a dome.
[ ] Add cube-map environment lighting.
[ ] Add font renderer.  Use the freetype library to make glyph atlas.
[ ] Fix bugs in PBR shading.
[ ] Add height maps to PBR shading.
[ ] Add AO maps to PBR shading.
[ ] Can we soften the edges of shadows?
[ ] Build a cube map by using the render engine itself.
