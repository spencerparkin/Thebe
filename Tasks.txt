Some things I'd like to achieve...

[x] Generate MIP maps for textures.
[x] Compress textures.
[x] Add cube-maps for a dome.
[ ] Add cube-map environment lighting.
[x] Add font renderer.  Use the freetype library to make glyph atlas.
[x] Fix bugs in PBR shading.
[ ] Add height maps to PBR shading.
[x] Add AO maps to PBR shading.
[ ] Can we soften the edges of shadows?
[ ] Build a cube map by using the render engine itself.
[x] Add FSAA or MSAA.  Can some of the principles here be used for soft shadows?  Can't see how right now.
[ ] Impulses should not be the primary means of preventing interpenetration between physics objects.  Collision objects should get separated by the collision system whether or not impulses are applied.
[ ] Figure out why my crappy GJK implimentation is just plain wrong.
[ ] Figure out why the physics system occationally bogs down the frame-rate.  Probably an explosion of contact points is generated.
